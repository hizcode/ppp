Preface

"Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead." - Admiral Farragut

Programming is the art of expressing solutions to problem so that a computer can execute those solutions.

This book is for someone who has never programmed before but is willing to work hard to learn.
How long will that take?
If you work by yourself, maybe 15 hours a week for 14 weeks.

Three months may seem a long time, but there's a lot to learn and you'll be writing your first simple programs after about an hour.
All learning is gradual.

Without understanding software you are reduced to believing in "magic" and will be locked out of many of the most interesting, profitable, and socially useful technical fields of work.

Why C++? You can't learn to program without a programming language, and C++ directly supports the key concepts and techniques used in real-world software.

This is not the easiest book on beginning programming; it is not meant to be. I just aim for it to be the easiest book from which you can learn the basics of real-world programming. That's quite an ambitious goal because much modern software relies on techniques considered advanced just a few years ago.

My fundamental assumption is that you want to write programs for the use of others, and to so responsibly, providing a decent level of system quality; that is, I assume that you want to achieve a leel of professionalism.

If you desire to use the work of others without understanding how things are done and without adding significantly to the code yourself, this book is not for you.

People often underestimate the complexity of programming as well as its value.

Because of its structure an practical aims, this book can also be used as a second book on programming for someone who already knows a bit of C++ or for someone who programs in another language and wants to learn C++.

Unless your name is Stroustrup, what I discuss here is not "your father's C++."

Programming is learned by writing programs. There is no substitute for writing code.

There is more to programming - much more - than following a few rules and reading the manual. Understanding thefundamental ideals, principles, and techniques is the essence of a good programmer. Only well-designed code has a chance of becoming part of a correct, reliable, and maintainable system.
